# Understanding Internet Networks, Web, and More

## 1. Introduction to Internet Networks and the Web

The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols. It enables global communication, data exchange, and resource sharing. The **Web (World Wide Web)** is a subset of the internet that consists of websites and web applications accessible through browsers.

### Key Components of Internet Networks:
- **IP Addresses:** Unique numerical identifiers assigned to each device on a network.
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** A hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its secure version (HTTPS) facilitate communication between web servers and clients.
- **Servers and Clients:** Servers store and provide web content, while clients (browsers) request and render web pages.
- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** Allow different software systems to communicate and exchange data.

**Example:**
When you enter `www.google.com` in a browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address. The request is then forwarded to Google's web server, which processes it and sends back a response containing the webpage data, which the browser renders.

# 2. Introduction to Backend Development, Node.js, and Express.js

## What is Backend Development?
Backend development refers to the server-side logic and database management of a web application. It processes client requests, manages data, and ensures smooth interaction between different components.

## Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows executing JavaScript code outside the browser. It is event-driven and non-blocking, making it ideal for scalable applications.

## Express.js
Express.js is a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies routing, middleware handling, and API creation.

**Example:**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Welcome to the Backend!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```
In this example, we create a basic Express.js server that listens for GET requests at the root URL (`/`) and responds with a message.

# 3. Request/Response/Testing/Routing in Express.js

Express.js follows a request-response cycle to handle user interactions with web applications.

### HTTP Methods and Their Uses:

1. **GET Method:** Retrieves data from a server.
```javascript
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "Fetching users" });
});
```

2. **POST Method:** Sends data to the server.
```javascript
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "User added successfully" });
});
```

3. **PUT Method:** Updates existing data on the server.
```javascript
app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: `User with ID ${req.params.id} updated` });
});
```

4. **DELETE Method:** Deletes data from the server.
```javascript
app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: `User with ID ${req.params.id} deleted` });
});
```

# 4. Code Your First Backend App

## Steps to Create a Simple Express.js Application:
1. Initialize a Node.js project:
```sh
npm init -y
```
2. Install Express.js:
```sh
npm install express
```
3. Create `index.js`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello, Backend World!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Run the app:
```sh
node index.js
```

# 5. All About Middleware in Express.js

Middleware functions in Express.js execute during the request-response cycle. They help in processing requests, authentication, logging, and error handling.

### Types of Middleware:

1. **Application-Level Middleware:** Runs for all requests.
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request received');
    next();
});
```

2. **Router-Level Middleware:** Applied to specific routers.
```javascript
const router = express.Router();
router.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("Middleware applied to router");
    next();
});
```

3. **Route-Specific Middleware:** Runs for a particular route.
```javascript
app.get('/profile', (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("Fetching profile data");
    next();
}, (req, res) => {
    res.send("Profile data");
});
```

4. **Error-Handling Middleware:** Catches and processes errors.
```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send("Something broke!");
});
```

# 6. Setting Up MongoDB Locally and on Cloud

## What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents.

### Steps to Install MongoDB Locally:
1. Download MongoDB from the official website.
2. Start MongoDB service.
3. Use MongoDB Compass for a graphical interface.

### Setting Up MongoDB Atlas (Cloud):
1. Create an account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).
2. Set up a new cluster.
3. Obtain a connection string and use it in your application.

---

# 7. Connecting with MongoDB using Mongoose

Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.

**Example:**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('your-mongo-uri', {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true
})
.then(() => console.log("Connected to MongoDB"))
.catch(err => console.error("Connection error", err));
```

# 8. MVC Pattern in a MERN Backend Project

The **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture is widely used in web applications.

### Example Structure:
```
project-folder/
│── models/
│    ├── User.js
│── routes/
│    ├── userRoutes.js
│── controllers/
│    ├── userController.js
│── app.js
```

This pattern helps separate concerns, making code more maintainable and scalable.
